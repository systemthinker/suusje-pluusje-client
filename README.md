# What this app is about
Captain Morse is a little word-guessing game using Morse Code. The app outlines the imaginative situation where Captain Morse is on his boat and sinking due to a storm. Signaling 'SOS' in Morse Code does not work ( ... ___ ...) - so the urgent riddle is: which message does work to the lives of Captain Morse and his crew.
